To help us on testing functions that returns Result, meiga provide us two functions: **assert_success** and **access_failure**.

Check the following pytest-based test for more information: [tests/unit/test_result_assertions.py](https://github.com/alice-biometrics/meiga/blob/master/tests/unit/test_result_assertions.py)
